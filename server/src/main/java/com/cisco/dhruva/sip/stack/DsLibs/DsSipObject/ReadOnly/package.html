Provides a set of classes used to efficiently represent SIP headers.  These headers are a "Read-Only" form of the header.
Each object contains an array of offsets and length that point to the fields in the original message.  Using these
classes as opposed to DsSipHeader objects is faster and creates less garbage, but the data they contain may not
be modified.
