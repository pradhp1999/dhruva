This package provides a set of classes used to represent SIP messages, allowing them to be accessed and manipulated. You can use these object classes independently of the three-tiered API; however, the APIs rely on these classes.

For information about how to create custom headers, refer to documentation of <code>DsSipHeader</code>.
