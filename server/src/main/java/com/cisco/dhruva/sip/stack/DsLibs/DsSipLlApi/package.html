The Low-Level API supports application development at the level of
abstraction of the SIP transaction. You are responsible for generating
all messages, handling of CANCEL and ACK messages, and for tying
transactions together to enable calls. This API effectively provides a
direct interface to the transaction state machines and transport
functions. You must use the Low-level API when you want to send
requests or receive responses not associated with a call.
