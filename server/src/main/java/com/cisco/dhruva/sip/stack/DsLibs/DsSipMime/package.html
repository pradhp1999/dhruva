The MIME Message Parser automatically transforms the MIME components of a SIP
message into MIME objects utilized by a user application. The MIME Message Parser
provides a convenience wrapper class, DsSipMimeMessage, to serve as an interface
to the Netscape MIME encoding and decoding package.
</p>
<p>
The initial implementation of the SIP User Agent Java MIME Message Parser uses
the freely-available Netscape MIME library. For further details on MIME parser
functionality, refer to Netscape's documentation on Building and Parsing MIME Messages.
