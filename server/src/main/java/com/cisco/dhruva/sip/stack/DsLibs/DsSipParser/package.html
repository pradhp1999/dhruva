The SIP User Agent Java provides a model for parsing SIP messages, headers, and URLs.
There has been a dramatic change in parsing philosophy from the 5.x version of the SIP
User Agent Java to the 6.0 version. In older versions, the parsing and objects created
were linked together. Now, there is a clear separation between parsing and creating the
objects from the tokens that the parser recognized.
<p>
The parser simply recognizes components of SIP messages and elements of SIP headers and
URLs and reports them through the various listener interfaces. You can ignore the
details of this by using the convenience methods provided in <b>DsSipMessage</b> and by the
<b>DsSipHeaders</b>, since these objects implement all of the listeners and behave accordingly.
<p>
This new philosophy changes the way user-defined headers and methods are registered with
the message parser. Instead of registering default constructors, you register just the
name of the header along with a parser. (Parsers for the known grammars have been provided
and can be reused as is.) Then, it is up to you to interact properly with the events that
the registered parser fires during a parse. So, it allows the flexibility to create the
appropriate object type at parse time.
<p>
The new model also allows you to determine, at parse time, the level of lazy parsing.
For example, the first Via header can now be deeply parsed, leaving the remaining Via
headers lazily parsed, which is different than the "all or none" strategy that was in
place in older versions.
<p>
For more information about registering your own headers, methods, and element IDs,
see the example programs:
